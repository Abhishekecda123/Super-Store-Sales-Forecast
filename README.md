<h1>Super-Store-Sales-Forecast</h1> 
I built an interactive Superstore Sales Dashboard in Power BI to track sales by state, category, and product, supported by DAX-based KPIs and dynamic slicers. A dedicated forecasting page predicts the next 15 days of sales with confidence intervals, enhanced by drill-down charts, KPI cards, and zoom sliders for detailed trend analysis and decision-making.

<h1>Key Features</h1>
1. Designed a comprehensive Sales Dashboard with state-wise, category-wise, and product-wise analysis, leveraging advanced visualizations and KPI cards for real-time performance tracking.

2. Implemented a 15-day sales forecast with upper & lower confidence intervals using Power BIâ€™s time-series forecasting and enhanced user analysis with zoom sliders, slicers, and drill-down charts.

3. Optimized dataset by conducting EDA in Power Query, handling missing values, applying feature selection, and creating new KPIs via DAX queries to drive accurate forecasting and decision-making.
